### Run-time Dimension

#### Quality Scenario: Performance

- **Stimulus:** The system receives 5000 concurrent course validation requests.
 
- **Source of Stimulus:** A peak period with multiple users submitting course data simultaneously.

- **Environment:** Production environment with high concurrency.

- **Artifact:**
  - `CourseValidator`
  - `Course database communicator`

- **Response:**
  - Requests are queued using a task queue.
  - The system processes the requests in parallel using a pool of worker threads.
  - Users are notified of their request status (e.g., queued or processed).

- **Response Measure:**
  - Validation throughput is maintained at 100 requests per second.
  - The system processes all requests within 60 seconds.

##### The architecture requires:

- **Task Queue:** A distributed queue to handle incoming validation requests.
- **Worker Threads:** A thread pool to process requests concurrently.
- **Load Balancing:** Distribute validation tasks across available system resources.

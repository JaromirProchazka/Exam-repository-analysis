# Scenario: Availability for Credit Assignment

## Scenario
A teacher attempts to award credit to a student during normal operation. During the process, the system encounters a temporary database connectivity issue, causing the credit assignment to fail. The system needs to ensure that the credit assignment process recovers quickly and completes without manual intervention.

## Solution




1. **Fault Detection**:  
   - Use heartbeat messages or ping/echo mechanisms to detect database connectivity issues promptly.  

2. **Fault Recovery**:  
   - Implement retry logic to handle database faults by reattempting the credit assignment.   

3. **Fault Prevention**:  
   - Utilize predictive modeling to analyze database performance and anticipate potential issues before they occur.

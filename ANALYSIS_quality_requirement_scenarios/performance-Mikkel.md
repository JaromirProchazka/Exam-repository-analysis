# Performance Analysis for Room Reservation System

## Scenario:
- During exam periods, multiple teachers need to access and view available rooms to schedule their exams. Teachers should be able to retrieve room availability and reservation details efficiently, even when many users are simultaneously interacting with the system.
- **Requirement**: The system must be able to handle 100 teachers viewing room availability at the same time, with an average response time of less than 2 seconds for retrieving room details.


## Scenario Breakdown:
- **Source of Stimulus**: Teacher.  
- **Stimulus**: Teacher requests to view room reservation details.
- **Artifact**: Room Reservation service.
- **Environment**: High-traffic period, with 100 teachers accessing the system simultaneously.
- **Response**: The system processes all requests and displays room details with minimal delays.
- **Measure**: The system provides room reservation information with an average response time of less than 2 seconds for 100 simultaneous teacher requests.


## Solution:
**Caching Room Data**:
   - Cache frequently accessed room details (e.g., availability, capacity) to minimize the load on the database and reduce the time it takes to retrieve room information.
